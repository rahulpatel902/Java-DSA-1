         * Call Stack => tracks all the function which are called
         * when java file runs and all that function will
         * occupies some memory in form of call stack as
         * stack frame;
         * ------------------------------------------------------
         * Stack frame => a piece of memory in call stack;
         * => the amount of memory occupied by a particular
         * function in call stack is called stack frame;
         * => stack frame stores all information of a particular
         * function like-> inputs, variable, that function
         * -----------------------------------------------------
         * => Whenever a new function is called then that function
         * will occupy a new stack frame (a piece of mem) in 
         * call stack (Stack of function which occupies some memory)
         * --------------------------------------------------------
         * Conclusion=>
         * 1. When a function is called then that function will 
         * occupy some memory (in call stack form) as a 
         * stack frame ( a piece of memory in call stack)
         * 
         * 2. And when a function finishes it's execution or the 
         * return statement is executed then the memory occupied 
         * by that function in call stack as stack frame will be 
         * cleared or removed, only when a function completes it's 
         * execution
         * --------------------------------------------------------
