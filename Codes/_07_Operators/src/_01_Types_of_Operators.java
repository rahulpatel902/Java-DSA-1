         * Operators In java
         * -----------------
         * Symbols that tells compiler to perform some operation
         * ------------------------------
         * Example 01 - [ sum = a + b; ]
         * Addition Expression = [a+b]
         * [a & b are called = operands]
         * [ + ] is called = operators
         * Operation = addition bcoz [+] operators
         * ------------------------------
         * Example 02 - [ sub = x - y; ]
         * Subtraction Expression = [x-y]
         * [x & y are called = operands]
         * [ - ] is called = operator
         * Operation = subtraction bcoz [-] operators
         * -------------------------------
         * Same for [*,/,+,-, more....]
